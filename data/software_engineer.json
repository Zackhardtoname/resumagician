content in context, and filtering that data down to the specific incidences that are of concern to our customers. we solve brand protection problems in online content in automated and creative ways.\nthe first piece is a big directed-crawling challenge, as we want to hit the interesting pages without having the resources to crawl the entire web. this involves interpreting signals to determine whether following a link is likely to be interesting along with a typical spectrum of web crawling concerns.\nthe second piece is filtering the content we find for the customer. we use primarily heuristic-based solutions today, but expect to increasingly incorporate machine learning and natural language processing for identification of content in the future. for example, we\u2019re

content in context, and filtering that data down to the specific incidences that are of concern to our customers. we solve brand protection problems in online content in automated and creative ways.\nthe first piece is a big directed-crawling challenge, as we want to hit the interesting pages without having the resources to crawl the entire web. this involves interpreting signals to determine whether following a link is likely to be interesting along with a typical spectrum of web crawling concerns.\nthe second piece is filtering the content we find for the customer. we use primarily heuristic-based solutions today, but expect to increasingly incorporate machine learning and natural language processing for identification of content in the future. for example, we\u2019re

specific incidences that are of concern to our customers. we solve brand protection problems in online content in automated and creative ways.\nthe first piece is a big directed-crawling challenge, as we want to hit the interesting pages without having the resources to crawl the entire web. this involves interpreting signals to determine whether following a link is likely to be interesting along with a typical spectrum of web crawling concerns.\nthe second piece is filtering the content we find for the customer. we use primarily heuristic-based solutions today, but expect to increasingly incorporate machine learning and natural language processing for identification of content in the future. for example, we\u2019re using machine learning to predict how customers will categorize issues

pounds of trash from the ocean and coastlines.\nbracelet sales are just the beginning. we are building an assortment of high quality, sustainably made products that will help people reduce their

content in context, and filtering that data down to the specific incidences that are of concern to our customers. we solve brand protection problems in online content in automated and creative ways.\nthe first piece is a big directed-crawling challenge, as we want to hit the interesting pages without having the resources to crawl the entire web. this involves interpreting signals to determine whether following a link is likely to be interesting along with a typical spectrum of web crawling concerns.\nthe second piece is filtering the content we find for the customer. we use primarily heuristic-based solutions today, but expect to increasingly incorporate machine learning and natural language processing for identification of content in the future. for example, we\u2019re using machine learning to predict how customers will categorize issues based on their previous reviews.\nin some cases we are also detecting intentionally bad behavior, in a cat and mouse game to

machine learning, big data and \u2018simply\u2019 writing responsive and elegant software that performs at enormous scale! collaborate with like-minded developers who do all of this while working in a fun and dynamic environment!\nour stack\nall of this data collection and filtering requires intelligent data storage, primarily in non-relational data stores within aws, including dynamodb, redis, and our column-oriented data store on top of s3. we also use redshift and redshift spectrum (with parquet/s3). we use mysql in rds for core relational data. we work in python - it\u2019s a versatile

of trash for every bracelet they sold. with the money raised from the sales of these bracelets, we have been able to employ hundreds of people to clean the ocean full-time and pull over 5 million pounds of trash from the ocean and coastlines.\nbracelet sales are just the beginning. we are building an assortment of high quality, sustainably made products that will help people reduce their

mentor others in a collaborative environment. this is all done in the context of a small but stable software business that values solving customer problems, challenging work, and fulfilling lives outside of work. join our team as we find and root out evil on the internet every day.\nour challenges\nwe have two big challenges: collecting the right data from the web about brand and product content in context, and filtering that data down to the specific incidences that are of concern to our customers. we solve brand protection problems in online content in automated and creative ways.\nthe first piece is a big directed-crawling challenge, as we want to hit the interesting pages without having the resources to crawl the entire web. this involves interpreting signals to determine whether following a link is likely to be interesting along with a typical spectrum of web crawling concerns.\nthe second piece is filtering the content we find for the customer. we use primarily heuristic-based solutions today, but expect to increasingly incorporate machine learning and natural language processing for identification of content in the future. for example, we\u2019re using machine learning to predict how customers will categorize issues based on their previous reviews.\nin some cases we are also detecting intentionally bad behavior, in a cat and mouse game to discover those bad (though intelligent) actors.\njoin our team and help to address these challenges while learning cool new technologies! grow your career in exploring challenging problem spaces like machine learning, big data and \u2018simply\u2019 writing responsive and elegant software that performs at enormous scale! collaborate with like-minded developers who do all of this while working in a fun and dynamic environment!\nour stack\nall of this data collection and filtering requires intelligent data storage, primarily in non-relational data stores within aws, including dynamodb, redis, and our column-oriented data store on top of s3. we also use redshift and redshift spectrum (with parquet/s3). we use mysql in rds for core relational data. we work in python - it\u2019s a versatile tool.\nall of our heavy lifting is done within aws, leveraging chef and ec2 autoscaling groups to handle changing loads without human intervention.\nwe have hired engineers from a variety of different backgrounds and have found that sharp engineers can identify shared concepts and quickly adapt to the new stack, so don\u2019t worry if your background does not include some of these technologies.\nto

content in context, and filtering that data down to the specific incidences that are of concern to our customers. we solve brand protection problems in online content in automated and creative

determine whether following a link is likely to be interesting along with a typical spectrum of web crawling concerns.\nthe second piece is filtering the content we find for the customer. we use primarily heuristic-based solutions today, but expect to increasingly incorporate machine learning and natural language processing for identification of content in the future. for example, we\u2019re

challenges: collecting the right data from the web about brand and product content in context, and filtering that data down to the specific incidences that are of concern to our customers. we solve brand protection problems in online content in automated and creative ways.\nthe first piece is a big directed-crawling challenge, as we want to hit the interesting pages without having the resources to crawl the entire web. this involves interpreting signals to determine whether following a link is likely to be interesting along with a typical spectrum of web crawling concerns.\nthe second piece is filtering the content we find for the customer. we use primarily heuristic-based solutions today, but expect to increasingly incorporate machine learning and natural language processing for identification of content in the future. for example, we\u2019re using machine learning to predict how customers will categorize issues based on their previous reviews.\nin some cases we are also
